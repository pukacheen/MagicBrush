Want to paint like a real artist? MagicBrush can help you! You can interactively draw in the web browser and have your painting transformed into the style of your favorite masterpiece in real time!

Neural Style Transfer is a (3 years) old magic which has become quite popular, but we want to make it better: interactive and real-time. The original algorithm from L. A. Gatys et. al. (2015) only allows you to transfer one image to one style at a time, and takes up to an hour to obtain a single frame of output even on a powerful machine. We use a faster neural network inspired by J. Johnson. et al. (2016) to make this application interactive and real-time, allowing users to actually engage with the transformation in the browser.
