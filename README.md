# neural-style-paint-demo

A sample app for Learn Teach Code that lets users paint on a collaborative canvas in real time over a WebSocket connection. Built with NodeJS, Express and SocketIO.

We want to stream canvas data to the server, apply style transfer, and get a resulting stream back

Currently: (check out the `hello.png` files!)
- we can stream single images to the server
- the server will transform it with style!

# Todo!!
- make the input images look better! this is one way to tell if the issue is our sketching or the neural network itself
